# VB.NET Password Hash Functions
This repository contains VB.NET functions that can be used to hash passwords securely using different hashing algorithms. The hash functions convert a plain-text password into a fixed-length string of characters that can be stored in a database or file.


## Supported Algorithms
- MD5 hashing function
- SHA1 hashing function
- SHA256 hashing function
- SHA512 hashing function


## Usage
To use any of the hash functions, simply call the corresponding function and pass the password string as an argument. For example:

```vb.net
Dim hashedPassword As String = HashPasswordSHA256("mypassword")
```
The hashed password can then be stored in a database or file.


## Security Considerations
While the use of hash functions is an important step in securing passwords, it is not enough to ensure complete security. It is recommended to also use other security measures, such as salting the passwords and using secure storage methods.
